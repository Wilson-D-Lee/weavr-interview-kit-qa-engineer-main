# Weavr - QA Engineer Test

## Back-end Automation

The `InterviewBackendTest` folder contains a sample project to test APIs using JUnit and RestAssured. In this project, you will find the configuration required to write tests for a number of endpoints by Go Rest ([https://gorest.co.in/](https://gorest.co.in/)), as well as a sample test class to start with.

**Requirements:**

- Using the already implemented create user endpoint, write a number of tests to cover the functionality of this endpoint.
- Implement whatever is required to write tests for the update user endpoint.

The information required to perform those tasks can be found here: [https://gorest.co.in/](https://gorest.co.in/).

## Front-end Automation

The `InterviewFrontendTest` folder contains a sample project to test a web application using Cypress. In this project, you will find the configuration required to write tests for the [Sauce Demo](https://www.saucedemo.com/) website.

To start with, the login part has already been implemented in the `sample_test.spec.js` file.

**Requirement:**

- Write an E2E test in the `sample_test.spec.js` file to buy any item from [https://www.saucedemo.com/](https://www.saucedemo.com/).
